# NFT Project Walkthrough

### Initialize the project

Use npm init
Setup your github repo
Initialize hardhat - install hardhat

```
npm install --save-dev hardhat
npx hardhat init
```

I had to reinstall node. Installed the node lts version so that hardhat can be used with node.

If error #2 is occuring which is the initialization error, then type the following code.

```
npx hardhat --verbose
```

This will fix the bug.
Choose your options and wait for hardhat to finish install.

### File cleanup
